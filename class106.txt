correalation value varies from -1 to 1 

1 means that the datasheets are closely and postively correalated-rising graph 

-1 means that the dtatasheets are closely but inversely correalated- falling graph 

0 or near to 0 datasheets are not correalated, so the dat points will be scattered on the graph

correalation is important to predict the future data based in the previously collected data

e.g. stock market
